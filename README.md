# ECEN5803-Project-1-Flowmeter   
This Project has a 4 part objective:   
1. Module-1 : Write a function to compute the square root of a number in Assembly.
2. Module-2 : Integrate FRDM-KL25Z's onboard I2C accelerometer.   
3. Module-3 : Setup UART Console for for the KL25Z.
4. Module-4 : Capture frequency and temperature from the ADC and compute the flow rate (gallons/min)

Also a Dhrystone benchmarking has to be performed on this microcontroller to caluclate the speed of the microcontroller.
